Hey Buddy !! I am a new file 
First do :
git init
git add . or git add filename
git commit -m "Your message"
git push (if you previously had done git push -u origin main)

Remember : if it is first time do this => git remote add origin "linkFromGithub"
And do this after commit line
This needs to be done just first time after that all will be set 
And then git push -u origin main that time and after that just use git push (git add filename or git add. and then git commit and then this )

+
If i do some changes and use git fetch + git merge or git pull only then these will be relflected on my local device
